# museum_mp3_player

I was volunteering at a museum that wanted to incorporate audio clips into their exhibits.  They wanted visitors to be able to choose from among several tracks at each station.

These scripts are designed to work with a speaker and several buttons; when hosted on a Raspberry Pi, they play specific tracks based on which button a listener pushes.
